									<p> Oki-Peter Ejiroghene is a Student of the department of Computer. Below are some of the pictures and hidden facts of Oki-Peter Ejiroghene

Back in 2014, when i was 18.5 years old, my family bought me an elite book laptop and a 56k modern . My parents would allow me use the laptop 5 hours a week. So i save up my alowances and bought myself a new android phone so i can browse the web all times i like.

On getting admission to college, i took the laptop, modem and the phone to college. At college i took some courses on web design which i am still yet to perfect

Currently i still take the course, but i belive i should be leaving the beginner level sooner than expected.</p>
